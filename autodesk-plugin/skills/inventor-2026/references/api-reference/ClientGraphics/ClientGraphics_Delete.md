| Name | Description |
| [Client Graphics - Vertex Color by Z Height](../../sample-programs/GraphicsDataSets_CreateColorSet_Sample.md) | This sample demonstrates using client graphics and some other functions that help to support display control. It uses the currently active part and replaces the part display with a display where the part's color varies from blue to red where blue is assigned to the lowest Z portion of the part and red is assigned to the highest Z portion of the part. Areas in between are represented by a smooth blend of color from blue to red. |
| [Client Graphics - Line](../../sample-programs/GraphicsNode_AddLineGraphics_Sample.md) | This sample demonstrates the creation of custom graphics using LineGraphics and LineStripGraphics. The same set of coordinate data is used for both types of graphics. Line graphics use two coordinates to define a line, and then the next two coordinates to define the next line, and so on through the defined coordinates. For the data provided, this results in gaps in the drawn curve. Line strips use the first two coordinates to define the first line and then the last point of the first line becomes the first point of the second line and the next coordinate is used as the end point of the second line. This results in the set of points being connected by a continuous set of lines, drawing a continuous curve. This sample also demonstrates two methods of defining the color for client graphics. In one case it uses an existing appearance asset, and in the other, it explicitly defines a color and assigns it. To use the sample you need to have an assembly or part document open. The program has two behaviors: the first time it is run it will draw the graphics. The second time it is run it deletes the previously drawn graphics. |
| [Text Using Client Graphics (Simple)](../../sample-programs/GraphicsNode_AddTextGraphics_Sample.md) | This sample demonstrates creating text using client graphics. It illustrates the simple case where the text is one font and is one line. |
| [Text Using Client Graphics (Multiple fonts and lines)](../../sample-programs/GraphicsNode_AddTextGraphics2_Sample.md) | This sample demonstrates creating text using client graphics. It illustrates the more complex case of changes in font and more than one line. |
| [Client Graphics - Triangle](../../sample-programs/GraphicsNode_AddTriangleFanGraphics_Sample.md) | This sample demonstrates the creation of client graphics triangles using triange fans and strips. It does this by drawing a cylinder. The end caps are triangle fans and the cylinder is made from a triangle strip. |
| [Client graphics - image in point graphics](../../sample-programs/PointGraphics_SetCustomImage_Sample.md) | The following sample demonstrates creation of point client graphics with a custom image. |
| [Selection of Surface Graphics Primitives](../../sample-programs/SelectSurfaceGraphicsPrimitives_Sample.md) | This demonstrates the ability to select client graphic primitives, by creating SurfaceGraphics and showing how you can select B-Rep entities within the graphics. You must have a part or assembly open and select a part of sat file which will be read in and displayed as client graphics. Depending on our responses to the program it will create the graphics so that only the node is selectable (which is all that was supported before), so that all of the primitives are selected, or so that only certain primitives are selectable (every other face in this case). |
| [Client graphics creation of 3D primitives](../../sample-programs/TransientBRep_CreateSolidCylinderCone_Sample.md) | This sample demonstrates the creation of 3D primitives (cylinder, cone, etc.) using client graphics. |
| [Create curve primitives](../../sample-programs/TransientGeometry_Sample.md) | This sample demonstrates the creation of curve primitives (lines, arcs, circles, etc.) using client graphics. |
