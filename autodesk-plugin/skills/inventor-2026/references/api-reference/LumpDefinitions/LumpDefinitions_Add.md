| Name | Description |
| [Transient solid body creation](../../sample-programs/SurfaceBodyDefinition_CreateTransientSurfaceBody_Sample.md) | The following sample demonstrates the creation of a transient solid block body. The newly created body is then displayed using client graphics in a part. |
| [Tapered Surface Using Offset Curve and Ruled Surface](../../sample-programs/TaperFace_Sample.md) | This sample demonstrates much of the wire body creation functionality. To run the sample you must have a part open and select a planar face. This sample then creates a trasient wire body using the geometry of the outside of the selected face. It then transforms and offsets that wire, and finally creates a ruled surface between the original wire and the offset wire. A base feature is created with the ruled surface. |
| [Transient B-Rep Ruled Surface with Lines](../../sample-programs/TransientBRepRuledSurf1_Sample.md) | Demonstrate creating a transient ruled surface. This sample uses all straight line segments for each of the sections. A part document must be open. |
| [Transient B-Rep Ruled Surface with Arc and Line](../../sample-programs/TransientBRepRuledSurf2_Sample.md) | Demonstrate creating a transient ruled surface. This sample uses straight line segments for once section and an arc for the second. A part document must be open. |
