# ExtrudeFeatures.Add Method

Parent Object: [ExtrudeFeatures](../ExtrudeFeatures/ExtrudeFeatures.md)

## Description

Method that creates a new Extrude feature.

## Syntax

ExtrudeFeatures.**Add**( ***Definition*** As [ExtrudeDefinition](../ExtrudeDefinition/ExtrudeDefinition.md) ) As [ExtrudeFeature](../ExtrudeFeature/ExtrudeFeature.md)

## Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | Type | Description |
| Definition | [ExtrudeDefinition](../ExtrudeDefinition/ExtrudeDefinition.md) | Input ExtrudeDefinition object that defines the extrude feature you want to create. An ExtrudeDefinition object can be created using the ExtrudeFeatures.CreateExtrudeDefinition method. It can also be obtained from an existing ExtrudeFeature object. |

## Samples

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [Delete Face, Boundary Patch and Stitch features](../../sample-programs/BoundaryPatchFeatures_Add_Sample.md) | Demonstrates creating Face, Boundary Patch and Stitch features. |
| [SurfaceBody Copy](../../sample-programs/CopyBodyFeature_Sample.md) | This sample demonstrates copying a surface body from one part to another. This is equivalent to the Promote command, but the API is much more flexible. In order for the sample to be self-contained, it creates two parts on the fly that will be used to demonstrate copying a body from one part to another. When copying a body into a part, you provide the surface body and a matrix to define its position in the new part. This sample creates a matrix based on the position of these parts within an assembly. |
| [Add a decal feature](../../sample-programs/DecalFeatures_Add_Sample.md) | This sample demonstrates the creation of a decal feature. |
| [Derived Parts and Assemblies](../../sample-programs/DerivedAssemblyComponents_Add_Sample.md) | This sample demonstrates the use of the API to create derived parts and assemblies. |
| [Using Inventor's error dialog](../../sample-programs/ErrorManager_Sample.md) | Demonstrates using Inventor's error dialog. |
| [Extrude Feature - Create Block with Pocket](../../sample-programs/ExtrudeFeature_Sample.md) | This sample demonstrates creating a simple solid consisting a block with a pocket. It shows how to create a sketch plane at a specified orientation to existing geometry. |
| [Edit profile of an extrude feature](../../sample-programs/ExtrudeFeature_Profile_Sample.md) | This sample demonstrates editing the profile of an extrude feature. |
| [Extrude sketch text](../../sample-programs/ExtrudeFeatures_AddByDistanceExtent_Sample.md) | This sample demonstrates the creation of an extrude feature from sketch text. |
| [Add iMate Definition](../../sample-programs/iMateDefinitions_AddMateiMateDefinition_Sample.md) | Add iMate definitions using AddMateiMateDefinition and AddInsertiMateDefinition. |
| [Create and Edit an Extrude Feature with a pocket](../../sample-programs/PartFeature_SetEndOfPart_Sample.md) | This sample demonstrates how to edit an extrude feature. It shows how to create a sketch plane at a specified orientation to existing geometry. |
| [Sketch from Face Silhouette](../../sample-programs/PlanarSketch_AddBySilhouette_Sample.md) | This sample creates a cylindrical solid, creates a new sketch plane and creates some new sketch lines from the actual edges and the apparent (silhouette) edges of the cylinder. |
| [Sketch profile control](../../sample-programs/ProfilePath_AddsMaterial_Sample.md) | This sample demonstrates the usage of the Profiles API to control the shape of the profile. The sample creates three concntric circles and creates an extrusion of the region between the inner circles. |
| [Create sheet metal rip feature](../../sample-programs/RipFeatures_Add_Sample.md) | This sample demonstrates the creation of a rip sheet metal feature. |
| [Thread Feature Create](../../sample-programs/ThreadFeature_Sample.md) | This sample demonstrates the creation of a thread feature. It creates a cylinder in a new part document and creates a thread feature on the cylinder. |
