# Selection Filters

When using the API to have the user select an entity you can specify which type(s) of entities are valid to be selected. For example, when using the [selectEntity](UserInterface_selectEntity.htm) method of the UserInterface object the second argument is the selection filter. Also when performing selections using in a custom command using the [SelectionCommandInput](SelectionCommandInput.htm) object you can define a filter to specify which type(s) of entities are selectable. The selection filter is a string. The complete list of all valid selection filter strings are listed below.
