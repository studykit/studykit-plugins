| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [classType](Arrange3DResultEnvelope_classType.htm) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |

## Properties

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [boundingBox](Arrange3DResultEnvelope_boundingBox.htm) | The bounding box of this result. The coordinates are defined with respect to the root component base coordinate system. |
| [envelopeDefinition](Arrange3DResultEnvelope_envelopeDefinition.htm) | Returns the envelope definition that provides the settings for this envelope. |
| [isValid](Arrange3DResultEnvelope_isValid.htm) | Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference. |
| [name](Arrange3DResultEnvelope_name.htm) | Gets and sets the name of the envelope as seen in the browser. |
