# MergeFacesFeatures Object

Derived from: [Base](Base.htm) Object

Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/Features/MergeFacesFeatures.h>

## Description

A collection object that supports the ability to merge faces. Merging faces is currently limited to a Direct Modeling design or a body in a base feature. The result of merging faces is a direct B-Rep modification, and the change is not represented as a feature in the browser. As a result, a MergeFacesFeature object does not exist, and this collection only supports the merging faces and not accessing any existing features.

## Methods

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [add](MergeFacesFeatures_add.htm) | Creates a new merge face feature. |
| [classType](MergeFacesFeatures_classType.htm) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |
| [createInput](MergeFacesFeatures_createInput.htm) | Creates a MergeFacesFeatureInput object for defining a simple merge face feature. Use properties and methods on this object to define the merge you want to create and then use the Add method, passing in the MergeFacesFeatureInput object. |

## Properties
