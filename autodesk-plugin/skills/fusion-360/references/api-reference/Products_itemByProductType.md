| [Additive Manufacturing MJF API Sample](AdditiveMJFManufacturingSample_Sample.htm) | Demonstrates how to automate the creation of an additive MJF manufacturing setup and arrange components within the build volume of a 3D printer.  To run the sample script, have a design with one or more components open in Fusion’s DESIGN workspace. This script will switch the UI from the DESIGN workspace to the MANUFACTURE workspace, create a new Manufacturing Model, and create an Additive Arrange using that manufacturing model as an input.  The setup will select an MJF 3D printer from Fusion’s machine library and a print setting from the print setting library. All components in the Manufacturing model will be automatically arranged within the build volume of the selected MJF machine. |
