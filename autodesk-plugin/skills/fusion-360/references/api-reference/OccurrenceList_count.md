| [Assembly traversal using recursion API Sample](AssemblyTraversalUsingRecursion_Sample.htm) | Traverses the entire structure of the currently open assemlby using a recursive function and displays the result in a message box. This will match the occurrence structure seen in the browser. |
| [Create Setups From Hole Recognition API Sample](CreateSetupsFromHoleRecognition_Sample.htm) | This sample script demonstrates how to create a correctly oriented setup using Hole Recognition functionality.  The Fusion Manufacturing Extension is required for Hole Recognition.  The script starts by opening a sample model from the CAM Samples folder via its URN. The model comprises a 3 way coupling containing holes in various orientations and mounted on a fixture. A reference setup is created for the model using a simple stock mode and offsets. The Hole Recognition feature of the Fusion Manufacturing Extension creates 5 hole groups containing 11 holes between them. For each unique hole group vector captured, a new setup is created and its orientation transformed to match the vector. |
| [Get Volume of Active Design API Sample](GetsVolumeOfActiveDesign_Sample.htm) | Traverses through the active design and totals the volume of every body within the design. |
