Parent Object: [FlatPatternComponent](FlatPatternComponent.htm)
Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/SheetMetal/FlatPatternComponent.h>

## Description

Returns all assembly constraints in this component and any sub components. The assembly constraints returned are all in the context of this component so any joints in sub components will be proxies.
