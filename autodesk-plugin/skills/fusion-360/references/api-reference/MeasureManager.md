# MeasureManager Object

Derived from: [Base](Base.htm) Object

Defined in namespace "adsk::core" and the header file is <Core/Application/MeasureManager.h>

## Description

The MeasurementManager class provides some generic measurement utilities that can be used for most entity types.

## Methods

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [classType](MeasureManager_classType.htm) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |
| [getOrientedBoundingBox](MeasureManager_getOrientedBoundingBox.htm) | Calculates an oriented bounding box for the input geometry. The bounding box is tight fitting to the input geometry and is particularly useful when you want to calculate a bounding box that is not oriented to be parallel to the model x-y-z plane. |
| [measureAngle](MeasureManager_measureAngle.htm) | Measures the angle between the input geometry. |
| [measureMinimumDistance](MeasureManager_measureMinimumDistance.htm) | Measures the minimum distance between the two input geometries. |

## Properties

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [isValid](MeasureManager_isValid.htm) | Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference. |
| [objectType](MeasureManager_objectType.htm) | This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object.   It's often useful to use this in combination with the classType method to see if an object is a certain type. For example: if obj.objectType == adsk.core.Point3D.classType(): |
