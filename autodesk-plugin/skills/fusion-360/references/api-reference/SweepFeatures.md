## Methods

| Name | Description |
| [add](SweepFeatures_add.htm) | Creates a new sweep feature. |
| [classType](SweepFeatures_classType.htm) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property.

| [createInput](SweepFeatures_createInput.htm) | Creates a SweepFeatureInput object for defining a simple sweep feature with only a path and no guide rail or surface. Use properties and methods on this object to define the sweep you want to create and then use the Add method, passing in the SweepFeatureInput object. |
| [createInputForSolid](SweepFeatures_createInputForSolid.htm) | Creates a SweepFeatureInput object for defining a simple sweep feature from a B-Rep solid with a path. Use properties and methods on this object to define the sweep you want to create, and then use the Add method, passing in the SweepFeatureInput object. |
| [item](SweepFeatures_item.htm) | Function that returns the specified sweep feature using an index into the collection. |
| [itemByName](SweepFeatures_itemByName.htm) | Function that returns the specified sweep feature using the name of the feature. |

## Properties
