Parent Object: [ModelParameter](ModelParameter.htm)

![Preview](../images/TestTubeSmall.png)This functionality is provided as a preview
of intended future API capabilities. You are encouraged to use it and report any problems or suggestions using the
[Fusion API and Scripts](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/fusion-360-api-and-scripts/bd-p/22) forum.

Because this is a preview of future functionality, there is the possibility that it will change, which will possibly
break any existing programs that use this functionality. Because of that, you should never deliver any programs that use
any preview capabilities. For a distributed program, you should wait until it has moved from preview to released state.

Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/Fusion/ModelParameter.h>

## Description

Gets and sets the value of the parameter when it is a text parameter. This can be determined by checking the valueType property. Setting this value will cause the current expression to be overwritten. If the parameter is not a text parameter, the value of this property should be ignored and setting will fail.
