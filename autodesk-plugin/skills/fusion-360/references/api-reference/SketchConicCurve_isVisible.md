# SketchConicCurve.isVisible Property

Parent Object: [SketchConicCurve](SketchConicCurve.htm)
Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/Sketch/SketchConicCurve.h>

## Description

When a sketch is created, geometry is sometimes automatically added to the sketch. For example a sketch point that references the origin point is always included and if a face was selected to create the sketch on, geometry from the face is also included. This automatically created geometry behaves in a special way in that it is invisible but is available for selection and it also participates in profile calculations. It's not possible to make them visible but they can be deleted and they can be used for any other standard sketch operation.
