# ArrangeProfileOrFaceEnvelopeDefinition Object

Derived from: [ArrangeEnvelopeDefinition](ArrangeEnvelopeDefinition.htm) Object

Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/Arrange/ArrangeProfileOrFaceEnvelopeDefinition.h>

## Description

The ArrangeProfileEnvelopeDefinition object represents envelopes defined by a profile or face in an Arrange feature. This defines the settings of the envelope and the EnvelopeResult provides access to the resulting envelope and its contents.

## Methods

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [classType](ArrangeProfileOrFaceEnvelopeDefinition_classType.htm) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |

## Properties

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [frameWidth](ArrangeProfileOrFaceEnvelopeDefinition_frameWidth.htm) | Returns the parameter that controls the width of the envelope frame. This defines the offset distance of the objects from the edge of the frame. You can modify the value by using the properties on the returned ModelParameter object. |
| [isPartialArrangeAllowed](ArrangeProfileOrFaceEnvelopeDefinition_isPartialArrangeAllowed.htm) | Gets and sets if a partial arrange is allowed for this envelope. |
| [isValid](ArrangeProfileOrFaceEnvelopeDefinition_isValid.htm) | Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference. |
| [objectSpacing](ArrangeProfileOrFaceEnvelopeDefinition_objectSpacing.htm) | Returns the parameter that controls the space between objects in the arrangement. You can modify the value by using the properties on the returned ModelParameter object. |
| [objectType](ArrangeProfileOrFaceEnvelopeDefinition_objectType.htm) | This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object. |
| [parentArrange](ArrangeProfileOrFaceEnvelopeDefinition_parentArrange.htm) | Returns the parent ArrangeFeature this envelope is associated with. |
| [placementClearance](ArrangeProfileOrFaceEnvelopeDefinition_placementClearance.htm) | Returns the parameter that controls the offset of the objects from the base plane of the arrangement (the "up" direction). You can modify the value by using the properties on the returned ModelParameter object. |
| [profilesAndFaces](ArrangeProfileOrFaceEnvelopeDefinition_profilesAndFaces.htm) | Gets and sets an array containing any combination of Profile and planar BRepFace objects. These objects define the shapes of the envelopes. Currently, if a Profile is used, it must be the only Profile in its parent sketch. |
