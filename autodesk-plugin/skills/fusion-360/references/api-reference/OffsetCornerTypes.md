# OffsetCornerTypes Enumerator

## Description

Specifies the different types of corners that can be created when offsetting a wire body. These settings are used when the curves are offset outwards, which creates a gap at the corner. These represent the three ways the gap is filled.
Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion\FusionTypeDefs.h>

| LinearOffsetCornerType | 1 | Creates lines that are tangent to the offset curves and connect at the corner. |
