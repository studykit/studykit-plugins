# VolumetricModelToMeshFeatures Object ![Preview](../images/TestTubeLarge.png)

Derived from: [Base](Base.htm) Object

Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/Features/VolumetricModelToMeshFeatures.h>

![Preview](../images/TestTubeSmall.png)This functionality is provided as a preview
of intended future API capabilities. You are encouraged to use it and report any problems or suggestions using the
[Fusion API and Scripts](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/fusion-360-api-and-scripts/bd-p/22) forum.

Because this is a preview of future functionality, there is the possibility that it will change, which will possibly
break any existing programs that use this functionality. Because of that, you should never deliver any programs that use
any preview capabilities. For a distributed program, you should wait until it has moved from preview to released state.

## Description

Collection that provides access to all of the existing volumetric model to mesh features in a component and supports the ability to create new Volumetric Model To Mesh features.

## Methods

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [add](VolumetricModelToMeshFeatures_add.htm) | Add a new volumetric model to mesh feature. To create a new volumetric model to mesh feature use the createInput function to create a new input object and use the methods and proprties on that object to define the required input for an volumetric model to mesh feature. Once the information is defined on the input object you can pass it to the Add method to create the Volumetric Model to Mesh. |
| [classType](VolumetricModelToMeshFeatures_classType.htm) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |
| [createInput](VolumetricModelToMeshFeatures_createInput.htm) | Create a new VolumetricModelToMeshFeatureInput object. |
| [item](VolumetricModelToMeshFeatures_item.htm) | Function that returns the specified item using an index into the collection. |
| [itemByName](VolumetricModelToMeshFeatures_itemByName.htm) | Returns the item with the specified name. |

## Properties

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [count](VolumetricModelToMeshFeatures_count.htm) | The number of features in the collection. |
| [isValid](VolumetricModelToMeshFeatures_isValid.htm) | Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference. |
| [objectType](VolumetricModelToMeshFeatures_objectType.htm) | This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object. |

## Samples

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [Volumetric Custom Feature API Sample](VolumetricCustomFeatureSample_Sample.htm) | Demonstrates how to create a Volumetric Custom Feature using the API for graph creation.  To run the sample script, have a document open in Fusion’s DESIGN workspace. This script will create a component with a box by sketching then extruding that sketch. It will then use that box as a boundary body and create a Volumetric Custom Feature.  The script will the create a gyroid lattice using the Volumetric Model API with the appropriate Graphs, Nodes and Connections for a minimal example. Finally, the script will convert that Volumetric Model to Mesh using the API and the VolumetricModelToMeshFeature. |

## Version

Introduced in version May 2025
