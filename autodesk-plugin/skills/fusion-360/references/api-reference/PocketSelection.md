# PocketSelection Object

Derived from: [CurveSelection](CurveSelection.htm) Object

Defined in namespace "adsk::cam" and the header file is <Cam/GeometrySelections/PocketSelection.h>

## Description

Pocket type for a curve selection. Allows planar BREP face selections for the input geometry. Overrides the GeometrySelection's the value property to include other faces if isSelectingSamePlaneFaces is set to true and the selection has been applied. The result of the value property call may contain duplicates. Note: selecting arbitrary faces, only planar faces are actually added to the list of faces to work with.

## Methods

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [classType](PocketSelection_classType.htm) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |

## Properties

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [error](PocketSelection_error.htm) | Gets the last warning string encountered after the selection was applied to a parent. |
| [extensionMethod](PocketSelection_extensionMethod.htm) | The desired extension method. TangentExtension by default. |
| [hasError](PocketSelection_hasError.htm) | Gets if errors were encountered when applying the selection to a a parent. |
| [hasWarning](PocketSelection_hasWarning.htm) | Gets if warnings were encountered when applying the selection to a parent. |
| [inputGeometry](PocketSelection_inputGeometry.htm) | Get or set the value of the input geometry. If the value originates from a component instead of an occurrence, or an occurrence outside of the CAM environment, then the subpath is checked against the CAM model tree. For some child classes, this may be the same as the value property, but might also consist of fewer elements. Valid elements depend on the capabilities of the derived class. An exception is thrown if the matching fails or the given entity does not match the expected type. |
| [isSelectingSamePlaneFaces](PocketSelection_isSelectingSamePlaneFaces.htm) | True if all planar faces lying in the same plane as the selected face should be automatically selected as well. False by default. |
| [isValid](PocketSelection_isValid.htm) | Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference. |
| [objectType](PocketSelection_objectType.htm) | This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object. |
| [value](PocketSelection_value.htm) | Returns the resulting value of the selection. In general, this returns the input selection, but child classes can override the return value if needed. Refer to the child classes comments for further details. The collection may contain duplicates. For OperationInputs, the return value may not be the same as for Operations, as additional geometry selected by child classes is not evaluated for OperationInputs. |
| [warning](PocketSelection_warning.htm) | Gets the last warning string encountered after the selection was applied to a parent. |

## Samples

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [Hole and Pocket Recognition API Sample](HoleAndPocketRecognition_Sample.htm) | This sample script demonstrates three different methods for feature recognition: one for holes and two for pockets.  The script starts by creating a simple component which is then used to demonstrate the three methods. After the features are recognised they are coloured and milling and drilling operations are created for each feature.  RecognizedHoleGroup returns a list of BRepFaces that can be used as selections for the drilling operation. RecognizedPocket also return some BRepFaces but it needs additional processing before the output can be used for creating machining operations.  The sample script demonstrates a couple of different methods, including finding the pocket BRepFaces and creating sketches from the recognized pockets.  This script works only if the Manufacturing Extension is active. |
