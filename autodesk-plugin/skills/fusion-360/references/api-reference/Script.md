## Description

## Methods

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [classType](Script_classType.htm) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |
| [edit](Script_edit.htm) | Invokes the default edit behavior for this script or add-in. |
| [run](Script_run.htm) | Runs this script or add-in, if it's not already running. |
| [stop](Script_stop.htm) | If this script or add-in is running, this method will stop it. The isRunning property can be used to determine if it is running. If the script or add-in is not running and this method is called, there is no effect. |
| [unlink](Script_unlink.htm) | Unlinks this script or add-in. This removes it from Fusion's list of linked scripts and add-ins, so it is no longer displayed in the dialog, and if it's an add-in, it will no longer run on startup. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| [appStoreURL](Script_appStoreURL.htm) | For an add-in installed from the Autodesk App Store, this property returns the URL on the store for the page of this app. This property returns an empty string for all scripts and add-ins not installed from the App Store and if there is a problem determining the URL for an App Store app. |
