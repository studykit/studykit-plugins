## Description

A PostConfigurationQuery can be used to search a LibraryLocation for a set of PostConfiguration objects matching the required properties.

## Methods

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [classType](PostConfigurationQuery_classType.htm) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |
| [execute](PostConfigurationQuery_execute.htm) | Query for specific posts. This PostConfiguration query. |

| [capability](PostConfigurationQuery_capability.htm) | Specifies the capability to search for in the post library. |
| [isValid](PostConfigurationQuery_isValid.htm) | Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference. |
| [location](PostConfigurationQuery_location.htm) | The location specifies the location to search in the post library. Setting the location clears any previous specified URL. |

| Name | Description |
| [Manufacturing Workflow API Sample](ManufacturingWorkflowAPISample_Sample.htm) | Manufacturing Workflow API Sample This sample script starts by creating a simple component which is then used to describe a milling workflow. It creates a setup, a few operations, pick some tools from a Fusion sample tool library using loops and queries and ends up post-processing the operations out using an NC Program. |
| [Turning Workflow API Sample](Turning_Workflow_API_Sample_Sample.htm) | Turning Workflow API Sample This sample script starts by opening a simple component which is then used to describe a basic turning workflow.
