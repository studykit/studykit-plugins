| Type | Description |
| [NurbsCurve3D](NurbsCurve3D.htm) | Returns the new NurbsCurve3D object or null if the creation failed. |

## Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | Type | Description |
| controlPoints | Point3D[] | An array of control point that define the path of the spline. |
| degree | integer | The degree of curvature of the spline. |
| knots | double[] | An array of numbers that define the knot vector of the spline. The knots is an array of (>=degree + N + 1) numbers, where N is the number of control points. |
| isPeriodic | boolean | A bool specifying if the spline is to be Periodic. A periodic spline has a start point and end point that meet forming a closed loop. |
