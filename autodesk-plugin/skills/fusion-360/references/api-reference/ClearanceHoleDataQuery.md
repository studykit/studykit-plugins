## Methods

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [allFastenerTypes](ClearanceHoleDataQuery_allFastenerTypes.htm) | This method returns an array of all the available fastener types for the given standard. To get the available standards, use the allStandards property. |
| [allSizes](ClearanceHoleDataQuery_allSizes.htm) | This method returns an array of all the sizes for the given standard and fastener type. Valid standards and fastener types can be obtained using the allStandards and allFastenerTypes functions. |
| [classType](ClearanceHoleDataQuery_classType.htm) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |
| [create](ClearanceHoleDataQuery_create.htm) | Static method to create a new ClearanceHoleDataQuery object. The ClearanceHoleDataQuery object is a utility object that provides methods to query for the valid clearance hole definitions defined in Fusion. This object provides similar functionality as the hole command dialog to find valid clearance standards, fastener types, and sizes, which can be used to create clearance hole features. |
| [standardCustomName](ClearanceHoleDataQuery_standardCustomName.htm) | Method that returns the custom name for a given standard. The custom name is the localized name of the standard using the current language specified for Fusion. |
