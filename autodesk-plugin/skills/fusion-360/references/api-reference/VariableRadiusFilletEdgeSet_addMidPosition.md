## Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | Type | Description |
| position | [ValueInput](ValueInput.htm) | The position where the new radius is to be created. This is a value between 0 and 1 where 0 is at the start of the edge and 1 is at the end. If the ValueInput uses a real then it is interpreted as a unitless value. If it is a string then it must resolve to a unitless value. |
| radius | [ValueInput](ValueInput.htm) | A ValueInput object that defines the radius at the defined position. If the ValueInput uses a real then it is interpreted as centimeters. If it is a string then the units can be defined as part of the string (i.e. "2 in"). If no units are specified it will be interpreted using the current default units for length. |
