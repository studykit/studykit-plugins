# Canvas.isVisible Property

Parent Object: [Canvas](Canvas.htm)
Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/Image/Canvas.h>

## Description

Returns if the canvas is currently visible in the graphics window. The isLightBulbOn property of the canvas controls if the canvas should be displayed or not, but even when true, the canvas may not be visible because the occurrence that references the component may not be visible. It's also possible to turn off the visibility of all canvases for a component. This property takes all of that into account when reporting if the canvas is visible or not.
