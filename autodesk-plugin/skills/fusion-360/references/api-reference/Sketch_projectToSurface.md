# Sketch.projectToSurface Method

Parent Object: [Sketch](Sketch.htm)
Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/Sketch/Sketch.h>

## Description

Projects the specified set of curves onto the specified set of faces using the specified method of projection. if the projection type is along a vector, then the directionEntity argument must be supplied. if the projectionType is the closest point method, the directionEntity argument is ignored.

## Syntax

* [Python](#Python)
* [C++](#C++)

"sketch\_var" is a variable referencing a [Sketch](Sketch.htm) object.```` ``` # Uses no optional arguments. ``` ```` |

"sketch\_var" is a variable referencing a [Sketch](Sketch.htm) object.  ```` ``` #include <Fusion/Sketch/Sketch.h>  // Uses no optional arguments. returnValue = sketch_var->projectToSurface(faces, curves, projectType);  // Uses optional arguments. returnValue = sketch_var->projectToSurface(faces, curves, projectType, directionEntity); ``` ```` |

## Return Value

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Description |
| [SketchEntity](SketchEntity.htm)[] | Returns an array of the sketch entities that were created as a result of projection the specified curves onto the faces. |

## Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | Type | Description |
| faces | BRepFace[] | An array of BRepFace objects that the curves will be projected onto. |
| curves | Base[] | An array of various curve objects that will be projected onto the faces. The curves can be sketch curves and points, BRepEdge objects, ConstructionAxis objects, and ConstructionPoint objects. |
| projectType | [SurfaceProjectTypes](SurfaceProjectTypes.htm) | Specifies which projection type to use which defines the direction of projection. If this is set to AlongVectorSurfaceProjectType the directionEntity argument must be provided. |
| directionEntity | [Base](Base.htm) | if the projectType argument is AlongVectorSurfaceProjectType, this argument must be specified and defines the direction of projection. It can be a linear BRepEdge, a BRepFace where the normal will be used, a SketchLine, or a ConstructionLine.   This is an optional argument whose default value is null. |
