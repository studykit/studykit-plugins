# FilletFeatures Object

Derived from: [Base](Base.htm) Object

Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/Features/FilletFeatures.h>

## Description

Collection that provides access to all of the existing fillet features in a component and supports the ability to create new fillet features.

## Methods

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [add](FilletFeatures_add.htm) | Creates a new fillet feature. |
| [addFullRoundFillet](FilletFeatures_addFullRoundFillet.htm) | Creates a new full round fillet feature. |
| [classType](FilletFeatures_classType.htm) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |
| [createFullRoundFilletInput](FilletFeatures_createFullRoundFilletInput.htm) | Creates a FullRoundFilletFeatureInput object. Use properties and methods on this object to define the fillet you want to create and then use the addFullRoundFillet method, passing in the FullRoundFilletFeatureInput object. |
| [createInput](FilletFeatures_createInput.htm) | Creates a FilletFeatureInput object. Use properties and methods on this object to define the fillet you want to create and then use the Add method, passing in the FilletFeatureInput object. |
| [item](FilletFeatures_item.htm) | Function that returns the specified fillet feature using an index into the collection. |
| [itemByName](FilletFeatures_itemByName.htm) | Function that returns the specified fillet feature using the name of the feature. |

Create a new design and add a box that is at least 2 cm on each side. The script creates a constant radius, variable radius and chord length fillets. After creating each one, it deletes it and then creates the next. To see any of the fillets that were deleted, undo to get the fillet back. |
