# Operation.isLightBulbOn Property

Parent Object: [Operation](Operation.htm)
Defined in namespace "adsk::cam" and the header file is <Cam/Operations/Operation.h>

## Description

Gets if this operation is currently visible in the graphics window. Use the isLightBulbOn to change if the eye icon beside the operation node in the browser is on or not. Parent nodes in the browser can have their light bulb off which affects all of their children so this property does not indicate if the operation is actually visible, just that it should be visible if all of its parent nodes are also visible. Use the isVisible property to determine if it's actually visible.
