# MoveFeaturePointToPositionDefinition Object

Derived from: [MoveFeatureDefinition](MoveFeatureDefinition.htm) Object

Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/Features/MoveFeaturePointToPositionDefinition.h>

## Description

The MoveFeaturePointToPositionDefinition object defines a move feature described by a point and an offset. The distances define offsets in the X, Y, and Z directions in either design or component space. To not move the input entities at all the offset distances should be set to the current location of the point in either design or component space. Adding or subtracting to those values will then move the entities that distance. It's best to experiment with the command interactively to understand the behavior.

## Methods

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [classType](MoveFeaturePointToPositionDefinition_classType.htm) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |

## Properties

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [isDesignSpace](MoveFeaturePointToPositionDefinition_isDesignSpace.htm) | Gets and sets if the translation is defined with respect to the design or component space. Design space is the same as the root component space. |
| [isValid](MoveFeaturePointToPositionDefinition_isValid.htm) | Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference. |
| [objectType](MoveFeaturePointToPositionDefinition_objectType.htm) | This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object.   It's often useful to use this in combination with the classType method to see if an object is a certain type. For example: if obj.objectType == adsk.core.Point3D.classType(): |
| [parentMoveFeature](MoveFeaturePointToPositionDefinition_parentMoveFeature.htm) | Returns the parent MoveFeature object |
| [point](MoveFeaturePointToPositionDefinition_point.htm) | Gets and sets the entity that defines a point in space. This can be a sketch point, a construction point, or a BRepVertex.   To use this property, you need to position the timeline marker to immediately before this feature. This can be accomplished using the following code: thisFeature.timelineObject.rollTo(True) |
| [xDistance](MoveFeaturePointToPositionDefinition_xDistance.htm) | Gets the model parameter that controls the offset in the X direction. You can use properties |
| [yDistance](MoveFeaturePointToPositionDefinition_yDistance.htm) | Gets the model parameter that controls the offset in the Y direction. You can use properties |
| [zDistance](MoveFeaturePointToPositionDefinition_zDistance.htm) | Gets the model parameter that controls the offset in the Z direction. You can use properties |
