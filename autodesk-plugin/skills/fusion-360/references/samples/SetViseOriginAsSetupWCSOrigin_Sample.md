# Set Vise Origin As Setup WCS Origin API Sample

## Description

This sample script demonstrates how to define our setup WCS origin relative to our vise origin from either a component, a sketch point or a joint origin.

The Work Coordinate System is a reference point set in our CAM workspace and on our machine. All machine coordinates are drawn from the WCS. This script demonstrates defining the WCS by each of 4 alternative methods:

Setup by default with no origin defined.

Setup using vise origin as WCS origin.

Setup using a sketch point as WCS origin.

Setup using a joint origin as WCS origin.
