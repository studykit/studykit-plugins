# Guard setup

This setup is needed only for Codex. It installs the project-local agents
`guard_claims_auditor`, `guard_doc_auditor`, `guard_agents_md_auditor`, and
`guard_ext_docs_auditor`; it does not change any user-level Codex configuration.

First identify the current project's Git root. Explain that installation will
create those four TOML files under `.codex/agents/`, then obtain the user's
explicit confirmation before making that change. A direct request to install it
counts as that confirmation.

Run the installer next to this skill with an absolute path, passing the project
root:

```sh
uv run --script <absolute-path-to-this-skill>/scripts/install_agent.py --project <git-root>
```

If the destination already exists, leave it unchanged and report that fact.
Replace it only when the user explicitly requests replacement, using `--force`.
Tell the user to start a new Codex session after installation so the named agent
is discovered.

For file-review rules, users may keep the portable Guard action names
`guard:doc-auditor`, `guard:agents-md-auditor`, and `guard:ext-docs-auditor`; the Codex hook
maps them to the installed underscore-named agents. The `doc-auditor` switch and an explicit
matching `doc_review_rules` entry are still required. Unmatched files are not reviewed.

Also tell them that guard's hooks are separate from this, and that installing and
enabling the plugin does not switch them on: Codex skips plugin-bundled hooks until
the user reviews and trusts the hook definition, and it does so silently. If guard
appears to do nothing under Codex while `codex plugin list` reports it installed and
enabled, untrusted hooks are the first thing to check — this skill cannot affect them. Dispatch this named agent in a fresh context, not with the
parent's full conversation history.
