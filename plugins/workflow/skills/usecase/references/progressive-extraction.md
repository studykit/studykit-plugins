# Progressive Use Case Extraction

When the conversation reveals enough context across the four gaps,
draft a use case and present it to the user for confirmation. On
confirmation, publish it as a workflow `usecase` issue.

## Required fields before drafting

Every draft must name:

- **Actor** — specific person or system (not "the user"). Same name
  the project already uses for that role.
- **Goal** — one concrete thing the actor wants to accomplish.
- **Situation** — trigger and context, concrete (not "when managing
  data").
- **Flow** — numbered, user-visible steps and responses.
- **Expected outcome** — observable, ideally measurable.

Abstraction discipline: stay at the user level. The contract is in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/authoring/common/usecase-authoring.md`
under **Abstraction discipline**; the conversion table (before/after
rewrites for the most common leaks) and per-field obligations are in
the companion guard at
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/authoring/common/usecase-abstraction-guard.md`.
Apply the guard before presenting any draft to the user — rewriting
a leaked phrase mid-draft is cheaper than fixing it after the user
has already reacted to the wrong wording.

## How to present the draft

Frame the draft and ask one confirmation question. Example:

> Based on what you've described, here's a candidate use case:
>
> **Share meeting summary**
> - **Actor:** Meeting organizer
> - **Goal:** Share key decisions with absent teammates quickly
> - **Situation:** Just finished a 30-minute meeting; absent teammates
>   need the outcome
> - **Flow:** 1. Open the meeting record … 5. Send to the team channel
> - **Expected outcome:** Absent teammates receive a 3-line summary
>   within minutes; the organizer spends under 2 minutes instead of 20
>
> Does this capture it, or is there something to adjust?

## After core confirmation: drill into precision

Once the core is agreed, probe for the optional surfaces, one
question at a time:

- **Validation** — user-visible input constraints, limits, required
  formats.
- **Error handling** — what the actor sees when things fail.
- **Boundary conditions** — empty input, max items, concurrent access,
  timeouts.

Capture whichever apply. Skip when the use case has no meaningful
constraints or failure modes — these sections are optional in
`usecase-issue-authoring.md`.

## Resolve authoring before publishing

Resolve the `usecase` authoring docs through the
`<authoring-resolver>`. Pass `--type usecase` and `--role issue` since
this skill writes the issue-side surface only:

```bash
workflow mustread --type usecase --role issue --purpose author
```

Read the files the resolver returns. They define:

- The workflow `usecase` issue body shape (`Description`, `Actors`,
  `Current Draft`, `Open Questions`, optional `Related Work`,
  `Supersedes`, `Resume`).
- The provider's markup convention (heading form, link form).
- Any provider-specific anti-patterns to avoid.

## Publish the use case

Use `workflow issue new --type usecase` per the verb syntax at
`<runbook>`'s `issue-new` intent. Provide:

- `--title` — a short imperative phrase matching the actor's goal
  ("Share meeting summary").
- `--body-file` — a temp body file you drafted under
  `/tmp/workflow-usecase-drafts/<slug>.md`. Body sections follow the
  resolver-returned issue-side `usecase` authoring shape. Place the
  user's outstanding questions in the `Open Questions` section so
  they travel with the issue.
- `--assignee me` — by default the user owns the issue they
  discovered. The caller may override with a different assignee.
- `--related <ref>` — when this use case is part of a discovery
  session that produced earlier sibling use cases, link them
  pairwise. Sibling relationships use `related`, not `parent`; see
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/authoring/common/issue-authoring.md` for the
  canonical relationship intents.

After publish, capture the returned ref from the script's JSON output
and:

- Add a task `"Discovery: UC-<ref> <title>"` and mark it completed.
- Mention the published ref back to the user so they can open it.

## Anti-patterns

- Publishing a use case before the actor, goal, situation, flow, and
  expected outcome are all concrete. Half-formed use cases pollute the
  backlog.
- Packing multiple actor goals into one use case. Split first
  (`./usecase-splitting.md`), then publish each child.
- Inlining implementation choices into the body. Push those into
  `Open Questions` or surface them as a knowledge side effect
  targeting `spec` or `architecture`.
- Skipping the resolver call. The body shape and provider markup
  change between providers — never assume.
