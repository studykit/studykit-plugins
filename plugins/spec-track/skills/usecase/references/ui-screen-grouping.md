# UI Screen Grouping

After several UI-related use cases are confirmed in the session,
group them by screen so the design surface is visible end-to-end.
This procedure is optional — only run it when the user explicitly
asks for screen grouping or when discovery has produced 3+ UI use
cases the user wants to see together.

The skill never edits a curated knowledge page from this procedure.
Screen narrative belongs to the `context` knowledge page (Screens
section); the skill captures the screen-group label on participating
use case issues and surfaces the grouping in the wrap-up session
report. Further context-page authoring is left to the user.

## Procedure

For each screen the user names:

1. **Pick a group label** — short kebab-case, e.g.,
   `screen-dashboard`, `screen-meeting-detail`. Use the same label
   across every use case that belongs to the screen.
2. **Apply the label to participating `usecase` issues.** Use the
   provider's labelling form via `spec-track issue update` (verb syntax
   at `<runbook>`'s `issue-update` intent). When the backend doesn't
   support custom labels for this issue type, append a comment on
   each participating issue naming the screen group instead — comment
   syntax at `<runbook>`'s `issue-comment` intent.
3. **Note the screen narrative.** Capture screen purpose, the use
   cases that compose it, and the navigation flow between them in
   the wrap-up session report so the user has the material to
   author the `context` page (Screens section) separately.

## Mock generation (optional)

For each confirmed screen group, optionally generate an HTML mock so
the user can react to a concrete visual.

1. Confirm with the user that a mock is wanted; mocks are
   throwaway, not deliverables.
2. Dispatch `Agent(subagent_type: "spec-track:mock-html-generator")`
   with:
   - The participating `usecase` issue refs (the agent will fetch them
     via `spec-track issue fetch`).
   - The screen-group label.
   - Layout requirements (the user's wording verbatim).
   - An absolute output directory under
     `$(workflow project-dir .spec-track-cache/mocks/<screen-slug>/)`.
3. After the agent returns the output path, present the mock to the
   user (file path they can open in a browser). Gather feedback.
4. **Reflect mock feedback into use cases** through a follow-up
   question in the discovery loop. Do not edit `usecase` issue
   bodies in place from mock feedback alone — re-confirm with the
   user first.

## Anti-patterns

- Grouping unrelated use cases under one screen because the user
  mentioned them in the same breath. The grouping rule is shared
  visual surface, not topical proximity.
- Treating a mock as a use case deliverable. Mocks support
  discovery; the durable artifact is the use case issue.
- Letting the screen narrative live only in the session
  conversation. If it matters to the product, capture it in the
  wrap-up session report so the user can author the `context` page
  later — otherwise the screen story is lost when the session ends.
