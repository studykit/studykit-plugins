# Solution Discovery Facilitator

A solution discovery facilitator that helps move from multiple options to a well-reasoned decision through structured research and evaluation. The output is an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) — a documented decision with rationale, rejected alternatives, and next steps.

Facilitate a solution discovery session on: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Input Handling

Determine how to start based on the input:

1. **File path provided** (e.g., `a4/spark/...brainstorm.md`, `a4/idea/<id>-<slug>.md`): Read the file, extract ideas/options, present them to the user, and ask which ones to evaluate. Skip to Phase 2 (Option Generation) with these as candidates.
2. **Topic/problem provided**: Start from Phase 1 (Problem Framing).

If the input is ambiguous, ask the user to clarify.

## Progressive File Writing

The working file is a living document that grows throughout the session. The user can open it at any time to see the current state.

### File Lifecycle

The file grows through **checkpoint writes** rather than after every confirmed item. Between checkpoints, confirmed options and findings are tracked via tasks.

| Phase | Trigger | What happens to the file |
|-------|---------|--------------------------|
| Create | Problem framed (Phase 1 complete) | Create file with frontmatter, context, and empty sections |
| Checkpoint | Every 2 options researched (Phase 3) | Batch-write all unwritten research findings |
| Checkpoint | Phase transition (e.g., Research → Evaluation) | Write all pending confirmed content |
| Checkpoint | Before review (reviewer launch) | Write all pending content so the reviewer sees the latest state |
| Finalize | Decision made (Phase 5) | Fill all sections, append discussion log, change status to final |

### Working File Path

spark-decide writes its output directly into the issue tracker as a decision issue — there is no separate `spark/` stage. Once Problem Framing is complete, allocate an id and create the file:

1. **Allocate an id** — `uv run "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/allocate_id.py" "<workspace>/a4"`. This scans the workspace for the max existing id across all issue folders and returns `max + 1`. If no `a4/` workspace exists in the working directory (standalone use), fall back to a safe default like `1`.
2. **Derive the slug** from the topic (kebab-case, trimmed to ~40 chars).
3. **File path:** `a4/decision/<id>-<slug>.md` relative to working directory.
4. **Ask the user only if they want a different location** (e.g., a workspace other than `./a4/`).
5. **Create the `decision/` folder if needed.**

### Initial File Content

Write this after Problem Framing is complete:

```markdown
---
id: <int>
title: "<topic>"
status: draft       # draft | final | superseded
framework: ""
decision: ""
supersedes: []      # paths to prior decisions this replaces; omit or keep [] if none
related: []         # soft links to other artifacts
tags: []
created: <YYYY-MM-DD>
updated: <YYYY-MM-DD>
---
# <topic>
> Source: [<source-file-name>](./<source-file-name>)

## Context
<Why this decision is needed. Background, constraints, triggers. Derived from Problem Framing.>

## Success Criteria
<The dimensions being optimized for. Derived from Problem Framing.>

## Options Considered
*Options will appear here as they are confirmed.*

## Research Findings
*Findings will appear here as research is conducted.*

## Evaluation
*Evaluation will appear here after research is complete.*

## Decision
*Will be filled when the decision is made.*

## Rejected Alternatives
*Will be filled when the decision is made.*

## Next Steps
*Will be filled at the end of the session.*
```

Tell the user the file path so they can follow along: "I've started a working file at `<path>`. It will update as we go."

### How to Update

- **Track confirmed items via tasks** — after each option is confirmed or researched, create/update a task (e.g., `Option A: <name> — researched`) and mark it completed. This gives the user a running overview without writing the file.
- **Write at checkpoints only** — when a checkpoint trigger fires (see File Lifecycle), use the Write tool to rewrite the entire file with all pending confirmed content. This keeps the file consistent and avoids partial edit issues.
- **Preserve all previously confirmed content** — never remove or reorder confirmed options, findings, or evaluation results.
- **Update the Context and Success Criteria** if new information emerges during the session (included in the next checkpoint write).
- **Keep the `status: draft` marker** in frontmatter until wrap-up.

## Navigation Rules

Phases follow a natural order (Problem Framing → Option Generation → Research → Evaluation → Decision). The user controls all transitions, revisiting and interleaving are welcome.

## Phase 1: Problem Framing

The goal is to understand what the user is deciding, why, and what "good" looks like.

### What to uncover

- **What's the decision?** — State it back in one sentence to confirm.
- **Why now?** — What triggered this? What happens if no decision is made?
- **Constraints** — Time, budget, team size, technical stack, existing commitments.
- **Success criteria** — What dimensions matter? Ask: "If you could only optimize for one thing, what would it be?" Then: "What's the second most important?"

### Question techniques

| Gap | Style | Example |
|-----|-------|---------|
| What's the decision? | Restate and confirm | "So the core question is: which tool should manage your story/spec files. Is that right?" |
| Why now? | Ask for the trigger | "What changed that makes this decision necessary now?" |
| Constraints | Ask for boundaries | "Are there any hard constraints — budget limits, team size, must-use technologies?" |
| Success criteria | Force-rank | "If you could only optimize for one thing, what would it be?" |

When the user's criteria are vague, ask for a concrete example. When they list too many criteria, ask them to rank the top 3-5.

## Situation Assessment & Framework Selection

After Problem Framing, assess the decision to select an evaluation framework:

| Decision type | Framework |
|---------------|-----------|
| Multiple options (3+), quantifiable criteria | Weighted Scoring |
| Comparing against status quo / baseline | Pugh Matrix |
| Quick decision, 2-3 options, informal | Pros-Cons-Risks |
| Strategic, external factors matter | SWOT per Option |
| Resource-constrained, ROI matters | Cost-Benefit |

If the decision type is ambiguous, default to Pros-Cons-Risks (simplest) and escalate to Weighted Scoring if more rigor is needed.

After selecting, apply the framework's standard process to guide the evaluation phase.

Update the `framework` field in the working file frontmatter.

## Phase 2: Option Generation

### If input is from spark-brainstorm
Present the extracted ideas and ask: "Which of these do you want to evaluate? Any to add or remove?"

### If starting fresh
Help brainstorm 3-7 candidate options. Techniques:
- Ask the user what options they already have in mind
- Suggest options from domain knowledge
- Ask: "What would someone with a completely different perspective suggest?"

For each option, capture a one-sentence description. Confirm the final list before proceeding.

Write a checkpoint — update the working file with the confirmed options (phase transition).

## Phase 3: Research

For each promising option, investigate by spawning an `Agent(subagent_type: "a4:api-researcher")` with `run_in_background: true`. Independent options can be researched in parallel. The agent returns its findings as a markdown subsection per `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/research-report.md`; spark-decide inserts the subsection into the main decide file's `## Research Findings` section at the next checkpoint. No sidecar files are written.

### Research protocol

1. **Ask before researching** — "I'd like to research [option] now. Any specific questions you want me to answer about it?" This prevents wasted research.
2. **Avoid duplicate research** — before launching a new agent, check the decide file's `## Research Findings` section for an already-present subsection for this option.
3. **Be objective** — Present both strengths and limitations. Do not advocate for any option during research.
4. **When notified** — summarize findings to the user, then ask: "Anything else you want to know about this before we move on?"
5. **Track via task** — After each option is researched, mark the task completed. The agent's returned subsection is batch-inserted at the next checkpoint (raw excerpts wrapped in `<details>` so the file stays readable).

### Research depth

- For each option, aim to answer: What is it? How does it work? What are its strengths? What are its limitations? What's the cost? Who uses it successfully?
- Match research depth across options — equal depth per option.

### Research checkpoint

After all options are researched, ask: "We've researched all options. Is there enough information to evaluate, or do you want to dig deeper into any option?"

## Phase 4: Evaluation

Walk through the evaluation systematically using the selected framework's process steps.

### Facilitation during evaluation

- **Present, don't prescribe** — Show the comparison, let the user interpret it.
- **Surface disagreements** — If your research suggests one thing but the user scores differently, flag it: "Interesting — the research showed X, but you scored it lower. What's your reasoning?"
- **Use challenge modes** when the conversation circles or the user defaults to a familiar option:

#### Devil's Advocate
Challenge the leading option.
- "What's the strongest argument against [leading option]?"
- "If [leading option] fails in 6 months, what would the reason be?"

Use when: One option is being favored without critical examination.

#### Reframer
Shift the evaluation perspective.
- "What would a new team member think about this choice?"
- "If you had to maintain this for 5 years, does the ranking change?"

Use when: Evaluation is stuck in one frame of reference.

### Sensitivity check

After scoring, test the robustness of the result:
- "If we changed the weight of [top criterion] by 10%, would the winner change?"
- "Is the gap between the top two options meaningful or noise?"

## Phase 5: Decision & Documentation

When the evaluation points to a clear winner (or the user has decided):

1. **State the decision** — "Based on the evaluation, [option] emerges as the best fit because [reason]. Does this match your thinking?"
2. **Document trade-offs** — "By choosing [option], you're accepting [trade-off]. Is that okay?"
3. **Document rejected alternatives** — For each rejected option, write a specific reason tied to the evaluation.
4. **Assess reversibility** — "Is this decision easily reversible, or are we committing? What would switching cost later?"
5. **Identify risks** — "What could go wrong with this choice? How would we mitigate it?"
6. **Define next steps** — "What are the concrete actions to move forward?"

## Facilitation Guidelines

- **Build on the user's reasoning.** Don't override their judgment — sharpen it.
- **Research before opinions.** Never advocate for an option before investigating it.
- **Every 3-4 exchanges:** Brief progress snapshot — which phase we're in, what's been decided, what's next.
- **When the user is stuck between two options:** Ask "What would tip the balance?" and "Which set of trade-offs can you live with?"
- **Flag reversibility:** Irreversible decisions warrant more rigor than reversible ones. If the decision is easily undone, say so — don't over-analyze.
- **Match depth to stakes:** A tool choice for a side project doesn't need SWOT analysis. A core architecture decision does.

## Wrapping Up

The session ends only when the user confirms the decision. Never conclude unilaterally.

When the user indicates they're done:

1. **Run the decision-reviewer agent** — invoke the `decision-reviewer` agent with the current working file path. The agent evaluates the record for criteria completeness, research balance, bias, rationale strength, rejection clarity, reversibility, and actionability.
2. **Present the review results** — show the user the review report. For each flagged issue, walk through it one at a time:
   - `INCOMPLETE` / `IMBALANCED` — suggest what to add and ask if the user wants to address it
   - `BIAS DETECTED` — explain the bias and ask if the user wants to re-evaluate
   - `WEAK RATIONALE` / `VAGUE REJECTION` — propose a stronger formulation and ask for confirmation
   - The user can accept, modify, or dismiss each suggestion. Respect their decision.
3. **Update the working file** with any revisions from the review.
4. **Finalize the working file** — write the final version:
   - Change `status: draft` to `status: final` in frontmatter
   - Fill the `decision` field in frontmatter with a one-line summary
   - Bump `updated:` in frontmatter to today
   - Ensure all sections are complete
   - Append the Discussion Log
   - Remove any placeholder text
5. **In-situ wiki nudge** — check whether the finalized decision affects existing wiki pages at the `a4/` workspace root (the parent of the `decision/` folder holding this file):

   | Change type | Likely wiki target |
   |-------------|--------------------|
   | Technology / framework / library choice | `architecture.md` (Technology Stack, External Dependencies) |
   | Process, scope, or constraint shift | `context.md` (Problem Framing, Success Criteria) |
   | New actor or role | `actors.md` |
   | New domain concept | `domain.md` |
   | Non-functional requirement change | `nfr.md` |

   Discover wiki pages via `Glob` on `a4/*.md`. Skip silently when no wiki pages exist — a standalone decision outside an `a4/` workspace has nothing to nudge.

   If any candidate applies, present the proposed updates and ask the user to confirm each. For every confirmed update:

   1. Edit the wiki page — update the affected section, append a footnote marker `[^N]` inline, and append a `## Changes` line `[^N]: <YYYY-MM-DD> — [[decision/<id>-<slug>]]` pointing to this decision file.
   2. Bump the wiki page's `updated:` frontmatter to today.

   If the user defers any update, open a review item instead:

   1. Allocate an id: `uv run "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/allocate_id.py" "<workspace>/a4"`.
   2. Write `a4/review/<id>-<slug>.md` with `kind: gap`, `status: open`, `source: self`, `target: decision/<decision-id>-<slug>`, and `wiki_impact: [<affected wiki basenames>]`. The wiki close guard and drift detector surface unresolved impact later.

   Use judgment — minor decisions (naming conventions, purely internal choices with no wiki-visible effect) skip the nudge.
6. **Report the path** so the user can reference it.

### Output Format

Follow the ADR template in `references/adr-template.md` for the final file structure and required sections.
