# RenderEnvironment Object

Derived from: [Base](Base.htm) Object

Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/Render/RenderEnvironment.h>

## Description

A render environment that is used when defining the scene for rendering. You see these in the user interface in the "Environment Library" tab of the "Scene Settings" dialog. Use this with the backgroundEnvironment property of the SceneSettings object to set a render environment. For a custom render environment, use the loadCustomEnvironment method to statically create a custom environment and assign it to the backgroundEnvironment property.

## Methods

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [classType](RenderEnvironment_classType.htm) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |
| [loadCustomEnvironment](RenderEnvironment_loadCustomEnvironment.htm) | Statically creates a RenderEnvironment which can be used to set the environment for a scene using the SceneSettings.backgroundEnvironment property. |
