# ConstructionPlaneByPlaneDefinition Object

Derived from: [ConstructionPlaneDefinition](ConstructionPlaneDefinition.htm) Object

Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/Construction/ConstructionPlaneByPlaneDefinition.h>

## Description

The definition for a non-parametric construction plane. All constructions planes will return this type of definition regardless of method used to initially create them.

## Methods

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [classType](ConstructionPlaneByPlaneDefinition_classType.htm) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |

## Properties

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [isValid](ConstructionPlaneByPlaneDefinition_isValid.htm) | Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference. |
| [objectType](ConstructionPlaneByPlaneDefinition_objectType.htm) | This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object. |
| [parentConstructionPlane](ConstructionPlaneByPlaneDefinition_parentConstructionPlane.htm) | Returns the ConstructionPlane object |
| [plane](ConstructionPlaneByPlaneDefinition_plane.htm) | Gets and sets the position of the construction plane. Setting this property is only valid for a construction plane in a direct edit design or in a base feature. Construction planes in a parametric model are parametrically controlled and cannot be directly edited. |

## Version

Introduced in version August 2014
