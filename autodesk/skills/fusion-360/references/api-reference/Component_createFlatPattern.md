# Component.createFlatPattern Method

Parent Object: [Component](Component.htm)
Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/Components/Component.h>

## Description

Creates a flat pattern of the sheet metal folded body. The isSheetMetal property of the BRepBody object can be used to determine if a particular body can be flattened. Creating a flat pattern will fail if a flat pattern already exists in the component. You can determine if a flat pattern already exists by checking if the flatPattern property returns a FlatPattern object or null.
