| Name | Description |
| [Create Setups From Hole Recognition API Sample](CreateSetupsFromHoleRecognition_Sample.htm) | This sample script demonstrates how to create a correctly oriented setup using Hole Recognition functionality.  The Fusion Manufacturing Extension is required for Hole Recognition.  The script starts by opening a sample model from the CAM Samples folder via its URN. The model comprises a 3 way coupling containing holes in various orientations and mounted on a fixture. A reference setup is created for the model using a simple stock mode and offsets. The Hole Recognition feature of the Fusion Manufacturing Extension creates 5 hole groups containing 11 holes between them. For each unique hole group vector captured, a new setup is created and its orientation transformed to match the vector. |
| [Manage Participant Bodies API Sample](ParticipantBodiesSample_Sample.htm) | Demonstrates how to manage participant During Cut operation. Same API can be used to manage participants During intersection also. |
