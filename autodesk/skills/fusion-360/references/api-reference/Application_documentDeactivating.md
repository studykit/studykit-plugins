Copy the code below into the .py file. Create another file that is the same name as the folder but has a .manifest extension and copy the JSON data below into that file. { "autodeskProduct": "Fusion360", "type": "addin", "author": "", "description": { "": "" }, "supportedOS": "windows|mac", "editEnabled": true } Run the "Scripts and Add-Ins" command and click the green plus button near the top of the dialog. Browse to the location where you created the folder and select the folder. The add-in should now be displayed in the list of add-ins on the "Add-Ins" tab of the dialog.
