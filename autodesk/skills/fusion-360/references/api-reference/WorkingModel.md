# WorkingModel Object

Derived from: [Design](Design.htm) Object

Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/Fusion/WorkingModel.h>

## Description

A type of product that utilizes the internal "Working Model" functionality within Fusion. This is used where a model is referenced into another product. For example, when you create a Manufacturing Model, you see a copy of the original design, but you can make isolated edits to it within the Manufacturing Model. This is using the internal Working Model functionality to create an associative reference to a specific component.

## Methods

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [activateRootComponent](WorkingModel_activateRootComponent.htm) | Makes the root component the active component in the user interface. This is the same as enabling the radio button next to the root component in the browser. |
| [analyzeInterference](WorkingModel_analyzeInterference.htm) | Calculates the interference between the input bodies and/or occurrences. |
| [areaProperties](WorkingModel_areaProperties.htm) | Returns the AreaProperties object that has properties for getting the area, perimeter, centroid, etc for a collection of 2D sketch profiles and/or planar surfaces that all lie on the same plane. |
| [classType](WorkingModel_classType.htm) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |
| [computeAll](WorkingModel_computeAll.htm) | Forces a recompute of the entire design. This is the equivalent of the "Compute All" command. |
| [createConfiguredDesign](WorkingModel_createConfiguredDesign.htm) | Converts this design into a configured design. The returned ConfigurationTable has a single row and no columns. You can use it to add columns and rows to define the configuration. |
| [createInterferenceInput](WorkingModel_createInterferenceInput.htm) | Creates an InterferenceInput object. This object collects the entities and options that are used when calculating interference. To analyze interference you first create an InterferenceInput supplying the entities and set any other settings and then provide this object as input to the analyzeInterference method. |
| [deleteEntities](WorkingModel_deleteEntities.htm) | Deletes the specified set of entities that are associated with this product. |
| [findAttributes](WorkingModel_findAttributes.htm) | Find attributes attached to objects in this product that match the group and or attribute name. This does not find attributes attached directly to the Product or Document objects but finds the attributes attached to entities within the product. |
| [findEntityByToken](WorkingModel_findEntityByToken.htm) | Returns the entities associated with the provided token. The return is an array of entities. In most cases an array containing a single entity will be returned but there are cases where more than one entity can be returned. An example of this is where a token is obtained from a face and subsequent modeling operations cause the face to be split into two or more pieces. All of the faces that represent the original face will be returned with the first face being the most logical match to the original face. |
| [modifyParameters](WorkingModel_modifyParameters.htm) | Modifies the values of many parameters all at once. Changing them all at once is more efficient than modifying them one at a time. |
| [physicalProperties](WorkingModel_physicalProperties.htm) | Returns the PhysicalProperties object that has properties for getting the area, density, mass, volume, moments, etc for a collection of 3D solid objects. |

## Properties

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [activeComponent](WorkingModel_activeComponent.htm) | Returns the component that is current being edited. This can return the root component or another component within the design. |
| [activeEditObject](WorkingModel_activeEditObject.htm) | Returns the current edit target as seen in the user interface. This edit target is defined as the container object that will be added to if something is created. For example, a component can be an edit target so that when new bodies are created they are added to that component. A sketch can also be an edit target. |
| [activeOccurrence](WorkingModel_activeOccurrence.htm) | Returns the occurrence that is currently activated, if any. This can return null in the case where no occurrence is activated and the root component is active. |
| [allComponents](WorkingModel_allComponents.htm) | Returns the Components collection that provides access to existing components in a design. |
| [allParameters](WorkingModel_allParameters.htm) | Returns a read only list of all parameters in the design. This includes the user parameters and model parameters from all components in this design. The parameters from Externally Referenced components are NOT included because they are in actuality, separate designs. |
| [analyses](WorkingModel_analyses.htm) | Gets the collection of design analyses associated with this design. |
| [appearances](WorkingModel_appearances.htm) | Returns the appearances contained in this document. |
| [attributes](WorkingModel_attributes.htm) | Returns the collection of attributes associated with this product. |
| [configurationRowId](WorkingModel_configurationRowId.htm) | Returns the ID of the row that defines this configuration. Use the isCongiguration property to determine if this Design is a configuration or not. If this is not a configuration, this property returns an empty string. |
| [configurationTopTable](WorkingModel_configurationTopTable.htm) | If this design is a configured design or a configuration, this property returns the associated ConfigurationTopTable object. If this is not a configured design or configuration, this property returns null. |
| [contactSets](WorkingModel_contactSets.htm) | Returns the contact sets associated with this design. |
| [designPlasticRules](WorkingModel_designPlasticRules.htm) | Gets the collection of plastic rules in the design. |
| [designSheetMetalRules](WorkingModel_designSheetMetalRules.htm) | Gets the collection of sheet metal rules in the design. |
| [designType](WorkingModel_designType.htm) | Gets and sets the current design type (DirectDesignType or ParametricDesignType) Changing an existing design from ParametricDesignType to DirectDesignType will result in the timeline and all design history being removed and further operations will not be captured in the timeline. |
| [exportManager](WorkingModel_exportManager.htm) | Returns the ExportManager for this design. You use the ExportManager to export the current design in various formats. |
| [fusionUnitsManager](WorkingModel_fusionUnitsManager.htm) | Returns a specialized UnitsManager that can set the default length units and work with parameters. |
| [isConfiguration](WorkingModel_isConfiguration.htm) | Gets if this design is a configuration. If this returns true, the configurationRowId can be used to get the row used to define this configuration. Also, when this is true, the design is essentially read-only and edits are either blocked from taking place or cannot be saved. |
| [isConfiguredDesign](WorkingModel_isConfiguredDesign.htm) | Gets if this design is a configured design. A configured design contains a configuration table. Use the configurationTable property to get the associated table. |
| [isContactAnalysisEnabled](WorkingModel_isContactAnalysisEnabled.htm) | Gets and sets whether contact analysis is enabled for all components. This is the equivalent of the "Disable Contact / Enable Contact" command. If this if True then any contact analysis defined (either all or contact sets) is enabled. if False, then no contact analysis is performed. |
| [isContactSetAnalysis](WorkingModel_isContactSetAnalysis.htm) | Gets and sets whether contact analysis is done using contact sets or between all bodies, independent of any contact sets. If True and the isContactAnalysisEnabled property is True then contact analysis is performed using contact sets. If False and isContactAnalysisEnabled is True, then contact analysis is performed between all bodies. If isContactAnalysisEnabled is False then no contact analysis is performed. |
| [isRootComponentActive](WorkingModel_isRootComponentActive.htm) | Gets whether the root component is the active edit target in the user interface.
