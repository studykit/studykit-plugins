# BetweenPointsRipFeatureDefinition Object

Derived from: [RipFeatureDefinition](RipFeatureDefinition.htm) Object

Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/SheetMetal/BetweenPointsRipFeatureDefinition.h>

## Description

The definition for an along edge rip.

## Methods

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [classType](BetweenPointsRipFeatureDefinition_classType.htm) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |

## Properties

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [gapDistance](BetweenPointsRipFeatureDefinition_gapDistance.htm) | Gets the ModelParameter that defines the gap distance of the rip. The value can be edited by using the properties of the returned ModelParameter object. |
| [isValid](BetweenPointsRipFeatureDefinition_isValid.htm) | Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference. |
| [objectType](BetweenPointsRipFeatureDefinition_objectType.htm) | This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object. |
| [pointOneEntity](BetweenPointsRipFeatureDefinition_pointOneEntity.htm) | Gets and sets the BRepEdge or BRepVertex that defines the first point for a between points rip. If a BRepEdge is returned the pointOneOffset property will control the position of the point along the edge. |
| [pointOneOffset](BetweenPointsRipFeatureDefinition_pointOneOffset.htm) | Gets the ModelParameter that defines the offset for the first point of a between points rip. This is the physical distance from the topological start of the edge. If the offset is either negative, or exceeds the edge length, then the point will be taken as the corresponding vertex of the edge. Returns null if the first point is defined by a vertex. The value can be edited by using the properties of the returned ModelParameter object. |
| [pointTwoEntity](BetweenPointsRipFeatureDefinition_pointTwoEntity.htm) | Gets and sets the BRepEdge or BRepVertex that defines the second point for a between points rip. If a BRepEdge is returned the pointTwoOffset property will control the position of the point along the edge. |
| [pointTwoOffset](BetweenPointsRipFeatureDefinition_pointTwoOffset.htm) | Gets the ModelParameter that defines the offset for the second point of a between points rip. This is the physical distance from the topological start of the edge. If the offset is either negative, or exceeds the edge length, then the point will be taken as the corresponding vertex of the edge. Returns null if the first point is defined by a vertex. The value can be edited by using the properties of the returned ModelParameter object. |
