Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/Fusion/Timeline.h>

## Description

## Methods

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [classType](Timeline_classType.htm) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |
| [deleteAllAfterMarker](Timeline_deleteAllAfterMarker.htm) | Deletes all objects in the timeline that are after the current position of the marker. |
| [item](Timeline_item.htm) | Function that returns the specified item in the timeline using an index into the collection. The items are returned in the order they appear in the timeline. |
| [moveToBeginning](Timeline_moveToBeginning.htm) | Moves the marker to the beginning of the timeline. |
| [moveToEnd](Timeline_moveToEnd.htm) | Moves the marker to the end of the timeline. |
| [movetoNextStep](Timeline_movetoNextStep.htm) | Moves the marker to the next step in the timeline. |
| [moveToPreviousStep](Timeline_moveToPreviousStep.htm) | Moves the marker to the previous step in the timeline. |
| [play](Timeline_play.htm) | Plays the timeline beginning at the current position of the marker. |

## Properties

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [count](Timeline_count.htm) | Returns the number of items in the collection. |
| [isValid](Timeline_isValid.htm) | Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference. |
| [markerPosition](Timeline_markerPosition.htm) | Gets and sets the current position of the marker where 0 is at the beginning of the timeline and the value of Timeline.count is the end of the timeline. |
| [objectType](Timeline_objectType.htm) | This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object. |
| [timelineGroups](Timeline_timelineGroups.htm) | Returns the collection of groups within the timeline. |
