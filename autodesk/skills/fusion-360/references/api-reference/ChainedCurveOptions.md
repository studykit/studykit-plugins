| Name | Value | Description |
| connectedChainedCurves | 1 | Will find curves that are geometrically connected without regards to the geometry condition at the connection. This is limited to sketch curves. |
| noChainedCurves | 0 | No chaining is done. This is useful when inputting a single entity and you don't want any chaining to be done. |
| openEdgesChainedCurves | 3 | Will find edges that are geometrically end connected and are open edges of an open BRepBody. |
| tangentAndOpenEdgesChainedCurves | 4 | Will find edges that are geometrically end connected, are tangent at the connection, and are open edges of an open BRepBody. |
| tangentChainedCurves | 2 | Will find curves that are geometrically connected and tangent at the connection. This will work for both sketch curves and edges. |
