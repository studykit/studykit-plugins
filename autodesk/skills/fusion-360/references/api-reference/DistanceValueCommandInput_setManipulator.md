# DistanceValueCommandInput.setManipulator Method

Parent Object: [DistanceValueCommandInput](DistanceValueCommandInput.htm)
Defined in namespace "adsk::core" and the header file is <Core/UserInterface/DistanceValueCommandInput.h>

## Description

Defines the position and orientation of the manipulator. The manipulator is only visible when both the isVisible and isEnabled properties are true. If those properties are true and the setManipulator has not been called, the manipulator will be displayed in a default location (0,0,0) and direction (1,0,0). Because of that the input is typically set to be invisible and/or disabled and then enabled once enough input has been specified that you can display the manipulator in the desired location.
