## Methods

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [classType](RadialMarkingMenu_classType.htm) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |
| [clear](RadialMarkingMenu_clear.htm) | Completely clears the contents of the marking menu. If left in this state, the marking menu will not be displayed. |
| [create](RadialMarkingMenu_create.htm) | This is used to create a sub-menu in a marking menu. This method creates a new, empty marking menu which can then be assigned to a position in the displayed marking menu to define the sub-menu. |
