# BRepBodyDefinition.createEdgeDefinitionByCurve Method

Parent Object: [BRepBodyDefinition](BRepBodyDefinition.htm)
Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/BRep/BRepBodyDefinition.h>

## Description

Using a curve in model space it creates a new BRepEdgeDefinition object that's associated with the body.

## Syntax

* [Python](#Python)
* [C++](#C++)

"bRepBodyDefinition\_var" is a variable referencing a [BRepBodyDefinition](BRepBodyDefinition.htm) object.```` ``` returnValue = bRepBodyDefinition_var.createEdgeDefinitionByCurve(startVertex, endVertex, modelSpaceCurve) ``` ```` |

"bRepBodyDefinition\_var" is a variable referencing a [BRepBodyDefinition](BRepBodyDefinition.htm) object. |

## Return Value

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Description |
| [BRepEdgeDefinition](BRepEdgeDefinition.htm) | Returns the created BRepEdgeDefinition object or null in the case of failure. |

## Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | Type | Description |
| startVertex | [BRepVertexDefinition](BRepVertexDefinition.htm) | Vertex definition that defines the start of the edge. For a closed curve, like a circle, you still need to provide a vertex on the curve but you should use the same BRepVertexDefinition for both the start and end vertices. |
| endVertex | [BRepVertexDefinition](BRepVertexDefinition.htm) | Vertex definition that defines the end of the edge. For a closed curve, like a circle, this should be the same vertex as used for the start vertex. |
| modelSpaceCurve | [Curve3D](Curve3D.htm) | A Curve3D object that defines the shape of the edge using 3D geometry in model space. Valid input is an Arc3D, NurbsCurve3D, Circle3D, Ellipse3D, EllipticalArc3D, or Line3D. |
