To use it, create a new add-in using the "Scrips and Add-Ins" command. Use any name you would like for the add-in. In the folder where the add-in was created edit the *add-in name*.py file and replace it's entire contents with the sample code below. You can also delete all the other files that were created for the add-in except for *add-in name*.manifiest. Start the add-in from the "Scripts and Add-Ins" dialog.
