## Remarks

This method has been retired and replaced by the addByNurbsCurve method on the SketchFixedSplines collection. Using this method creates a curve that can have unreliable behavior if it is edited in any way. The new method will create a stable curve and also supports the ability to modify it by providing a new NURBS curve definition.
