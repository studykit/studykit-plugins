# Application.registerCustomEvent Method

Parent Object: [Application](Application.htm)
Defined in namespace "adsk::core" and the header file is <Core/Application/Application.h>

## Description

This registers a new CustomEvent which is intended to be primarily used to send an event from a worker thread you've created back to your add-in running in the primary thread. It's also possible that two add-ins could be cooperating and another add-in can fire the event to your add-in.

## Syntax

* [Python](#Python)
* [C++](#C++)

"application\_var" is a variable referencing an [Application](Application.htm) object.```` ``` returnValue = application_var.registerCustomEvent(eventId) ``` ```` |

"application\_var" is a variable referencing an [Application](Application.htm) object. |

## Return Value

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Description |
| [CustomEvent](CustomEvent.htm) | Returns the registered CustomEvent or null in the case of failure, which would typically be because the provided eventId is not unique. |

## Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | Type | Description |
| eventId | string | This serves as the unique ID for this event and is used by the worker thread or other add-in to identify which custom event to fire using the fireCustomEvent method. |

## Samples

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [Custom Event for Command Dialog](CustomEventCommandDialog_Sample.htm) | Demonstrates using a custom event to process getting information in the background to display in a command dialog. This is an add-in and should be copied and pasted into an add-in project. |
| [Custom Event Sample](CustomEventSample_Sample.htm) | Demonstrates the ability to call into the main thread from a worker thread. This sample is an **add-in**. To use it, use the **Scripts and Add-Ins** command to create a new add-in. Delete all of the code in the newly created add-in and replace it with the code below. Have a model open that has a parameter named "Length". Load the add-in. The add-in will change the value of the parameter every two seconds using a random value between 1 and 10. |
| [Rendering Sample](RenderSample_Sample.htm) | Demonstrates using the Rendering capabilities in the API. This starts a series of local renderings to generate a series of frames, where the camera is repositioned and a parameter is modified for each frame to create a dynamic animation. To use the sample, have a design open that contains a parameter named "Length". It can be a user or model parameter. The sample will modify this parameter from a value of 0.1 cm to 15 cm, but you can change these values by editing the values of the paramStartVal and paramEndVal variables on lines 90 and 91 of the sample. It expects a folder named "C:\Temp\RenderSample" to exist, and will fail if it doesn't. The rendered frames will be written to that folder.  An example rendering is shown below where [this file](../ExtraFiles/RenderSample.f3d) was used. The parameter is modifying a move feature which results in changing the shape of an extrusion. The parameter could be driving anything and you could modify the code to edit more than one parameter. The result of this sample is a folder containing all of the rendered frames. You can process these to create an animation. The sample animation was created using GIMP.  ![Render Animation Sample](../images/RenderAnimationSample.gif) |
