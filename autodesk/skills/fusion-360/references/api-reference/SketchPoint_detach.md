# SketchPoint.detach Method

Parent Object: [SketchPoint](SketchPoint.htm)
Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/Sketch/SketchPoint.h>

## Description

This method disconnects the specified curve from the sketch point. The specified curve must use this point as one of its endpoints, and at least one other sketch curve must also use the point as its endpoint. Detaching the curve creates a new sketch point, which becomes the curve's end point. All other curves using the original sketch point will remain unaffected.
