| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [classType](DropDownControl_classType.htm) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |
| [deleteMe](DropDownControl_deleteMe.htm) | Deletes the ToolbarControl |

## Properties

| [controls](DropDownControl_controls.htm) | Gets the associated ToolbarControls collection. Through this you can add additional controls to the drop-down. |
| [id](DropDownControl_id.htm) | Gets the unique ID of this control. The ID is unique with respect to the other controls within the same panel, toolbar, or drop-down control. |

| [isVisible](DropDownControl_isVisible.htm) | Gets or sets if this control is currently visible. |
| [name](DropDownControl_name.htm) | Gets or sets the Name displayed for this drop down. This isn't used when the drop-down is in a toolbar because an icon is used in that case. |

| [parent](DropDownControl_parent.htm) | Gets the Parent object. When associated with a toolbar (right or left QAT or the NavBar) this returns the parent Toolbar object. When associated with a panel it returns the parent ToolbarPanel object. When associated with a control (DropDownControl) it returns the parent control. |
| [resourceFolder](DropDownControl_resourceFolder.htm) | This argument defines the resource folder that contains the images used for the icon when icons are used in the drop-down. Icons can be defined using either PNG or SVG files. More information about icons can be found in the user manual topic [User Interface Customization](UserInterface_UM.htm#IconsForCommands). |
