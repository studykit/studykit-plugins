# DistanceValueCommandInput.isMinimumValueInclusive Property

Parent Object: [DistanceValueCommandInput](DistanceValueCommandInput.htm)
Defined in namespace "adsk::core" and the header file is <Core/UserInterface/DistanceValueCommandInput.h>

## Description

Gets and sets if the value of the input includes the minimum value or is up to the minimum value. For example, if the minimum value is zero and this property is True, the minimum value can be zero. If this is False, the minimum value must be greater than zero. When the minimum value is first defined using the minimumValue property, this property is set to True. The value returned by this property is only meaningful when the hasMinimumValue property returns True.
