# SketchArcs Object

Derived from: [Base](Base.htm) Object

Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/Sketch/SketchArcs.h>

## Description

The collection of arcs in a sketch. This provides access to the existing arcs and supports the methods to create new arcs.

## Methods

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [addByCenterStartEnd](SketchArcs_addByCenterStartEnd.htm) | Creates a sketch arc that is centered at the specified point and between the two input points. |
| [addByCenterStartSweep](SketchArcs_addByCenterStartSweep.htm) | Creates a sketch arc that is always parallel to the x-y plane of the sketch and is centered at the specified point. |
| [addByThreePoints](SketchArcs_addByThreePoints.htm) | Creates a sketch arc that passes through the three points. |
| [addFillet](SketchArcs_addFillet.htm) | Creates a fillet between two sketch entities The side (quadrant) the fillet is created on is determined by the points specified. The point for each entity can be its startSketchPoint or endSketchPoint |
| [classType](SketchArcs_classType.htm) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |
| [item](SketchArcs_item.htm) | Function that returns the specified sketch arc using an index into the collection. |

## Properties

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [count](SketchArcs_count.htm) | Returns the number of arcs in the sketch. |
| [isValid](SketchArcs_isValid.htm) | Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference. |
| [objectType](SketchArcs_objectType.htm) | This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object. |
