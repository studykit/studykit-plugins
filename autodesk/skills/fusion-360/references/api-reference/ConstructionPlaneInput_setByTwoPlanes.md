# ConstructionPlaneInput.setByTwoPlanes Method

Parent Object: [ConstructionPlaneInput](ConstructionPlaneInput.htm)
Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/Construction/ConstructionPlaneInput.h>

## Description

This input method is for creating a construction plane at the midpoint between two planar faces or construction planes. This can result in a parametric or non-parametric construction plane depending on whether the parent component is parametric or is a direct edit component.

## Syntax

* [Python](#Python)
* [C++](#C++)

"constructionPlaneInput\_var" is a variable referencing a [ConstructionPlaneInput](ConstructionPlaneInput.htm) object.```` ``` returnValue = constructionPlaneInput_var.setByTwoPlanes(planarEntityOne, planarEntityTwo) ``` ```` |

"constructionPlaneInput\_var" is a variable referencing a [ConstructionPlaneInput](ConstructionPlaneInput.htm) object. |

## Return Value

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Description |
| boolean | Returns true if the creation of the ConstructionPlaneInput is successful. This will fail if the two planes are co-planar. |

## Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | Type | Description |
| planarEntityOne | [Base](Base.htm) | The first planar face or construction plane to create a bisecting plane between |
| planarEntityTwo | [Base](Base.htm) | The second planar face or construction plane to create a bisecting plane between |

## Samples

## Version

Introduced in version August 2014
