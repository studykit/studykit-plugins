# ReplaceFaceFeatureInput Object

Derived from: [Base](Base.htm) Object

Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/Features/ReplaceFaceFeatureInput.h>

## Description

This class defines the methods and properties that pertain to the definition of a replace face feature.

## Methods

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [classType](ReplaceFaceFeatureInput_classType.htm) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |

## Properties

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [isTangentChain](ReplaceFaceFeatureInput_isTangentChain.htm) | Gets and sets if any faces that are tangentially connected to any of the input faces will also be included in setting InputEntities. It defaults to true. |
| [isValid](ReplaceFaceFeatureInput_isValid.htm) | Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference. |
| [objectType](ReplaceFaceFeatureInput_objectType.htm) | This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object. |
| [sourceFaces](ReplaceFaceFeatureInput_sourceFaces.htm) | Gets and sets the entities that define the source faces to perform replace. The collection can contain the faces from a solid and/or from features. All the faces must be on the same body. |
| [targetBaseFeature](ReplaceFaceFeatureInput_targetBaseFeature.htm) | When creating a feature that is owned by a base feature, set this property to the base feature you want to associate the new feature with. By default, this is null, meaning it will not be associated with a base feature.   Because of a current limitation, if you want to create a feature associated with a base feature, you must set this property AND call the startEdit method of the base feature, create the feature, and then call the finishEdit method of the base feature. The base feature must be in an "edit" state to be able to add any additional items to it. |
| [targetFaces](ReplaceFaceFeatureInput_targetFaces.htm) | Gets and sets the entities that define the target faces. The new faces must completely intersect the part. The collection can contain the surface faces, surface bodies and construction planes. |
