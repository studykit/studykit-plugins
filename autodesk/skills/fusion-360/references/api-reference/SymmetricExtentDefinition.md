# SymmetricExtentDefinition Object

Derived from: [ExtentDefinition](ExtentDefinition.htm) Object

Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/Features/SymmetricExtentDefinition.h>

## Description

A definition object that is used to define the extents of a feature to be symmetric.

## Methods

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [classType](SymmetricExtentDefinition_classType.htm) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |
| [create](SymmetricExtentDefinition_create.htm) | Statically creates a new SymmetricExtentDefinition object. This is used as input when create a new feature and defining the starting condition. |

## Properties

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| [distance](SymmetricExtentDefinition_distance.htm) | Returns the current extent distance. If the SymmetricExtentDefinition object has been created statically and isn't associated with a feature this will return a ValueInput object. If the SymmetricExtentDefinition object is obtained from a feature this will return a ModelParameter object. You can use properties of the parameter to edit its value which will result in the feature updating. |
| [isFullLength](SymmetricExtentDefinition_isFullLength.htm) | Gets and sets if the distance defines the full extent length or half the length. A value of True indicates if defines the full length. |
| [isValid](SymmetricExtentDefinition_isValid.htm) | Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference. |
| [objectType](SymmetricExtentDefinition_objectType.htm) | This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object. |
| [parentFeature](SymmetricExtentDefinition_parentFeature.htm) | Returns the parent feature that this definition is associated with. If this definition has been created statically and is not associated with a feature this property will return null. |
| [taperAngle](SymmetricExtentDefinition_taperAngle.htm) | Returns the current taper angle. If the SymmetricExtentDefinition object has been created statically and isn't associated with a feature this will return a ValueInput object. If the SymmetricExtentDefinition object is obtained from a feature this will return a ModelParameter object. You can use properties of the parameter to edit its value which will result in the feature updating. |
