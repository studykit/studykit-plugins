# ConstructionPoint.createForAssemblyContext Method

Parent Object: [ConstructionPoint](ConstructionPoint.htm)
Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/Construction/ConstructionPoint.h>

## Description

Creates or returns a proxy for the native object - i.e. a new object that represents this object but adds the assembly context defined by the input occurrence.

## Syntax

* [Python](#Python)
* [C++](#C++)

"constructionPoint\_var" is a variable referencing a [ConstructionPoint](ConstructionPoint.htm) object.```` ``` returnValue = constructionPoint_var.createForAssemblyContext(occurrence) ``` ```` |

"constructionPoint\_var" is a variable referencing a [ConstructionPoint](ConstructionPoint.htm) object. |

## Return Value

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Description |
| [ConstructionPoint](ConstructionPoint.htm) | Returns the proxy object or null if this isn't the NativeObject. |

## Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | Type | Description |
| occurrence | [Occurrence](Occurrence.htm) | The occurrence that defines the context to create the proxy in. |

| [Create Setups From Hole Recognition API Sample](CreateSetupsFromHoleRecognition_Sample.htm) | This sample script demonstrates how to create a correctly oriented setup using Hole Recognition functionality.  The Fusion Manufacturing Extension is required for Hole Recognition.  The script starts by opening a sample model from the CAM Samples folder via its URN. The model comprises a 3 way coupling containing holes in various orientations and mounted on a fixture. A reference setup is created for the model using a simple stock mode and offsets. The Hole Recognition feature of the Fusion Manufacturing Extension creates 5 hole groups containing 11 holes between them. For each unique hole group vector captured, a new setup is created and its orientation transformed to match the vector. |
| [Set Vise Origin As Setup WCS Origin API Sample](SetViseOriginAsSetupWCSOrigin_Sample.htm) | This sample script demonstrates how to define our setup WCS origin relative to our vise origin from either a component, a sketch point or a joint origin.  The Work Coordinate System is a reference point set in our CAM workspace and on our machine. All machine coordinates are drawn from the WCS. This script demonstrates defining the WCS by each of 4 alternative methods:  Setup by default with no origin defined.  Setup using vise origin as WCS origin.  Setup using a sketch point as WCS origin.  Setup using a joint origin as WCS origin. |
