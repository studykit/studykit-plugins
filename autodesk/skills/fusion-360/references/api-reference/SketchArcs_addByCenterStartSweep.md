# SketchArcs.addByCenterStartSweep Method

Parent Object: [SketchArcs](SketchArcs.htm)
Defined in namespace "adsk::fusion" and the header file is <Fusion/Sketch/SketchArcs.h>

## Description

Creates a sketch arc that is always parallel to the x-y plane of the sketch and is centered at the specified point.

## Remarks

Sketch arcs always exist in a counterclockwise direction. Even though you can specify a negative sweep to define an arc in a clockwise direction, the result will still be a counterclockwise arc. This means if you query the created sketch arc, the start and end points may be opposite of what you expect.

## Syntax

* [Python](#Python)
* [C++](#C++)

"sketchArcs\_var" is a variable referencing a [SketchArcs](SketchArcs.htm) object.```` ``` returnValue = sketchArcs_var.addByCenterStartSweep(centerPoint, startPoint, sweepAngle) ``` ```` |

"sketchArcs\_var" is a variable referencing a [SketchArcs](SketchArcs.htm) object. |

## Return Value

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Description |
| [SketchArc](SketchArc.htm) | Returns the newly created SketchArc object or null if the creation failed. |

## Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | Type | Description |
| centerPoint | [Base](Base.htm) | The center point of the arc. This can be either an existing SketchPoint or a Point3D object. |
| startPoint | [Base](Base.htm) | The start point of the arc. The distance between this point and the center defines the radius of the arc. This can be either an existing SketchPoint or a Point3D object. |
| sweepAngle | double | The sweep of the arc. This is defined in radians and a positive value defines a counter-clockwise sweep. |
